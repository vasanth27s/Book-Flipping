# Book-Flipping Animation

This project demonstrates a book-flipping animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It creates a visual effect of flipping through pages of a book.

## How it Works

The animation is achieved by using CSS `transform` property to rotate the book covers and pages. JavaScript is used to control the flipping effect when the "Prev" and "Next" buttons are clicked.

## Features

- Smooth flipping animation
- Responsive design
- Ability to navigate between pages using buttons

## Usage

To use this animation:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

You can also customize the content of the book by modifying the HTML and CSS files to include your own images and text.
